{"name":"Ginger","tagline":"A minimal flexbox grid system named after a cute dog.","body":"# Ginger #\r\nGinger is a minimal flexbox 12 column grid system named after a cute dog. It doesn't give\r\nyou any fancy extras like some other frameworks, but what it does give you is a\r\nsolid lightweight grid system to make developing and designing your next site\r\neasy and quick.\r\n\r\n## Installing Ginger ##\r\nThere are three ways to install Ginger.\r\n\r\n1.  Clone the repository or download the files to your project\r\n2.  Install via bower using `bower install ginger --save`\r\n3.  Install via npm using `npm install ginger-grid --save`\r\n\r\n## Using Ginger ##\r\nGinger is rather easy to use. A basic structure of one column spans 12 columns\r\nwould look similar to this:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n  <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-12\">\r\n      ...\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nOr if you wanted two columns that span 6 each:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n  <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-6\">\r\n      ...\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-6\">\r\n      ...\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nGinger requires that you always use a `container` element to hold your `row` and\r\ncolumns and you must have a `row` element that holds your columns.\r\n\r\n## Class Names ##\r\nI kept Ginger very simple. Adding `col-*` will give you an element spanning\r\nhowever many columns indicated. So to add an element spanning 6 columns I would\r\nuse:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"col-6\">\r\n```\r\n### Miscellaneous Classes ###\r\n* `col-centered` - using this will center your element in the row\r\n* `col-right` - using this will push your element to the far right of the row\r\n\r\n## Responsiveness ##\r\nGinger is mobile responsive. By default, all columns break to 100% at the defined\r\nmobile breakpoint.\r\n\r\n## Extras ##\r\nGinger has a few extras to make life easy, because life is already too hard.\r\n\r\n### Text Classes ###\r\nThere are three text classes if you wish to use them for text alignment. Adding\r\n`text-left`,  `text-center`, or `text-right` will align your text accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Element Sizing ###\r\nAdding a class of `stretch` to your column will allow that element to stretch\r\nto the height of its siblings.\r\n\r\n## Adjusting Default Settings ##\r\nAdjusting the settings for Ginger allows you to customize the max-width of rows,\r\ncolumn padding, or mobile breakpoint. If you are going to adjust the settings it\r\nis best to make a copy of the file and include it in your project compilation\r\nprocess to avoid any settings being overwritten in the event of a Ginger update.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if I had a stylesheet called `theme.scss` using Ginger with custom\r\nsettings it would look something like this:\r\n```scss\r\n// vendor files\r\n@import 'scss/_settings.scss';\r\n@import 'ginger/ginger';\r\n```\r\nOr if you installed Ginger with bower, it would look something like this:\r\n```scss\r\n// vendor files\r\n@import 'scss/_settings.scss';\r\n@import 'bower_components/ginger/ginger';\r\n```\r\n## Issues / Bugs / Contributions ##\r\nIf you have feedback, find a bug, or want to make contributions, please don't\r\nhesitate to open an issue or make a pull request.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
