It doesn't give\r\nyou any fancy extras like some other frameworks, but what it does give you is a\r\nsolid lightweight grid system to make developing and designing your next site\r\neasy and quick.\r\n\r\n## Installing Ginger ##\r\nThere are three ways to install Ginger.\r\n\r\n1.  Clone the repository or download the files to your project\r\n2.  Install via bower using `bower install ginger --save`\r\n3.  Install via npm using `npm install ginger-grid --save`\r\n\r\nA fourth option is downloading the latest version of Ginger and including `ginger.min.css`\r\nfound in the `/dist/` folder into the `<head>` of your document. Only use this method if you don't want to customize\r\nany settings and/or need a pure CSS build.\r\n\r\n## Using Ginger ##\r\nGinger is rather easy to use. A basic structure that consists of an element that\r\nspans 12 columns would look similar to this:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n  <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-12\">\r\n      ...\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nOr if you wanted two columns that span 6 each:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n  <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-6\">\r\n      ...\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-6\">\r\n      ...\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nGinger requires that you always use a `container` element to hold your `row` and\r\ncolumns and you must have a `row` element that holds your columns.\r\n\r\n## Individual Flex-Basis Values ##\r\nIf you'd like to have columns with custom `flex-basis` values, you totally can.\r\nThis requires that you include `js/ginger.js` or `dist/ginger.min.js` in your project. A\r\ncustom `flex-basis` setup would look something like this:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n  <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"flex-basis-450\">\r\n      ...\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nWhatever value you give your `flex-basis-` class will be passed to the element's\r\n`flex-basis` property and is converted to pixels. Ginger does not require to include `ginger.js` so if changing\r\n`flex-basis` values with classes isn't for you, then move on!\r\n\r\n## Class Names ##\r\nThe goal for Ginger is to be very simple. Class names are simple too. Adding `col-*` will give you an element spanning\r\nhowever many columns indicated. So to add an element spanning 6 columns I would\r\nuse:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"col-6\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous Classes ###\r\n* `col-centered` - using this will center your element in the row\r\n* `col-right` - using this will push your element to the far right of the row\r\n\r\n## Responsiveness ##\r\nGinger is mobile responsive. By default, all columns break to 100% at the defined\r\nmobile breakpoint.\r\n\r\n## Extras ##\r\nGinger has a few extras to make life easy, because life is already too hard.\r\n\r\n### Text Classes ###\r\nThere are three text classes if you wish to use them for text alignment. Adding\r\n`text-left`,  `text-center`, or `text-right` will align your text accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Element Sizing ###\r\nAdding a class of `stretch` to your column will allow that element to stretch\r\nto the height of its siblings.\r\n\r\n## Adjusting Default Settings ##\r\nAdjusting the settings for Ginger allows you to customize the max-width of rows,\r\ncolumn padding, global flex-basis value, or mobile breakpoint. If you are going to adjust\r\nthe settings it is best to make a copy of the file and include it in your project\r\ncompilation process to avoid any settings being overwritten in the event of a\r\nGinger update.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if I had a stylesheet called `theme.scss` using Ginger with custom\r\nsettings it would look something like this:\r\n```scss\r\n// vendor files\r\n@import 'scss/_settings.scss';\r\n@import 'ginger/ginger';\r\n```\r\nOr if you installed Ginger with bower, it would look something like this:\r\n```scss\r\n// vendor files\r\n@import 'scss/_settings.scss';\r\n@import 'bower_components/ginger/ginger';\r\n```\r\n## Issues / Bugs / Contributions ##\r\nIf you have feedback, find a bug, or want to make contributions, please don't\r\nhesitate to open an issue or make a pull request.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to [Allison Perlis](http://allisonperlis.com/) for the rad Ginger\r\nlogo!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
